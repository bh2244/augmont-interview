## FullStack web exercise

1. UI: build a registration and login flow Android application

[Frontend Web exercise](https://github.com/Augmont-Gold/interview-exercises/blob/main/frontend.md)

2. Backend: Once the User is logged in, allow them to query salary data from an API that will you build

[Backend exercise](https://github.com/Augmont-Gold/interview-exercises/blob/main/backend.md)

Only logged in Users should be able to get access to this API page.

The restricted page should provide a few links or an test harness that demonstrates the API querying capabilities.

Returning a JSON response is completely acceptable.

_Extra Credit: Instead of JSON, display a UI that presents the data in a web friendly view._
